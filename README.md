## About
I am a college student based in Phoenix, Arizona who has a passion for technology and the outdoors. I've been developing and securing systems since my freshman year of high school, and I love to work on projects that test my skills and efficiency. I am currently pursuing a Bachelor of Science in Cybersecurity at [Grand Canyon University](https://gcu.edu/).
